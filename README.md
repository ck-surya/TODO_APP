# Project Name: TODO LIST

## Introduction
The TODO LIST app allows users to add tasks, mark them as complete, and delete them when necessary.

## Features
The app currently offers three main features:
- Add: Add new tasks to the list.
- Delete: Remove tasks from the list.
- Mark as done: Mark tasks as completed by adding a line-through effect.

## Installation
No installation is required. This app is built using React for practice purposes and is designed to be simple and easy to use.

## Usage
To add a new task, enter the task in the input box and click the "Add" button. The task will be added to the list below existing tasks.
To mark a task as done, simply tick the checkbox next to it. The task text will be crossed out to indicate completion.
To delete a task, click the "X" button next to it.

##Purpose
I created this project to practice various concepts in React, including:
- Components
- Props
- State management with useState
